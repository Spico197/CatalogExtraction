# üå≥ CED: Catalog Extraction from Documents

Rebuild document tree structures from plain texts.

üìÇ Files are available at [releases/tag/data-v1](https://github.com/Spico197/CatalogExtraction/releases/tag/data-v1).
üì¶ Model weights and logs are available at [releases/tag/model-v1](https://github.com/Spico197/CatalogExtraction/releases/tag/model-v1).

## ‚úàÔ∏è Abilities

- Concatenate OCR text pieces
- Compose paragraphs from sequences
- Extract document catalogs from plain texts

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Make sure you have `torch>=1.9.1` installed.
- Python>=3.7
- torch>=1.9.1

```bash
# better to create new environment in case of any potential package version mismatch
$ conda create -n doctree python=3.7
$ conda activate doctree
# install pytorch
$ echo 'install pytorch from https://pytorch.org/'

# install basics
$ pip install -e .
# if you want to test and make development, use this command
$ pip install -e .[dev]
# if you want to deploy demo on your local machine, use this
$ pip install -e .[demo]
# if you want to do both development and demo deployment, use this
$ pip install -e .[all]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

All task examples are listed in `examples/` .

### Concatenate text segments

- Train

```bash
# change setting file in `examples/text_concat/train/config.yaml`
$ bash examples/text_concat/train/run.sh
```

- Inference

```bash
# check `examples/text_concat/inference/run.sh` and change the task directory
$ bash examples/text_concat/inference/run.sh
```

### Concat & split paragraphs

We use the same task class to train paragraph split and text concatenation models

- Train

```bash
# change setting file in `examples/text_concat/train/config.yaml`
$ bash examples/text_concat/train/run.sh
```

- Inference

```bash
# check `examples/text_concat/inference/run.sh` and change the task directory
$ bash examples/text_concat/inference/run.sh
```

### Extract catalog structures

We use the hierarchical config mechanism in [REx](https://github.com/Spico197/REx).
Here, settings in `credit_eval.yaml` will override those in `base_config.yaml`.
You may want to add/change configurations in `credit_eval.yaml` to make it work.

- Train

```bash
# change setting file in `examples/doc_tree_construction/train/credit_eval.yaml`
$ bash examples/doc_tree_construction/train/run.sh
```

- Inference

```bash
# change `task_dir` in `examples/doc_tree_construction/inference/run_simple.py`
$ python examples/doc_tree_construction/inference/run_simple.py
```

## ‚òÅ Demonstration Deployment

1. change port, device, task directories and other settings in `demo_config.yaml`
2. run `python -u demo.py -c demo_config.yaml` to start
